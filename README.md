=================

This repository contains the schematics and PCB design files for the Footswitch hardware.
This is a peripheral meant to be used in conjunction with the MOD pedalboard (http://portalmod.com/) via its control-chain interface.


These files were created and can be improved with KiCAD, a free software Electronics CAD which is available at http://www.kicad-pcb.org/
